SIN Core
=============

Intro
-----
SINOVATE Infinity Nodes (SIN) is an open-source state of the art public blockchain for big data. It is a free open source peer-to-peer electronic cash system that is completely decentralized, without the need for a central server or trusted
parties.  Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly
with each other, with the help of a P2P network to check for double-spending.




Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run sin-qt.exe.

SIN Core is developed on top of the original Bitcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of SIN transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take for a few hours.
