Double-clicking the WebToolOpenWithaBrowser file will open SIN WebTool in your current browser.

Open your SIN-core wallet to use in Online Mode. Find and copy the address you want to process from the Coin Control window.

Access the Console tab by following the Help / Debug Window menu.
If your wallet is encrypted, temporarily disable it by following the steps below.

**yourpassword:** enter your valid wallet password instead.

**1000:** For example, the wallet was decrypted for 1000 seconds. You can set a time for you.
 

**Note:** If your wallet is not encrypted, you can skip this step. However, we strongly recommend protecting your wallet with a password.


After these processes, we can proceed to the Key File creation phase.
